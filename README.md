# Amalgam DApp Overview

for Submission at the Blockchain Hackathon 
Encode chain-abstraction-2024
=====================================
The DApp will allow patients to:
Book appointments with healthcare providers.
View real-time availability of doctors.
Manage medical records securely on the blockchain.
Connect their wallets for payment and identity verification.
Key Components
1. User Interface (UI)
Develop a user-friendly interface using frameworks like React or Vue.js.
Include features for:
User Registration/Login: Patients can register using their email and connect their wallets (MetaMask for EVM, Phantom for Solana).
Doctor Search: Allow patients to search doctors by specialty, availability, or location.
Appointment Booking: Display available slots and allow booking.
2. Smart Contracts
Use Solidity for EVM and Rust for Solana to create smart contracts that handle:
Appointment Management: Functions to book, cancel, and view appointments.
Data Storage: Store patient and appointment data immutably on the blockchain.
Example functions might include:
text
function bookAppointment(uint256 doctorId, uint256 timeSlot) public returns (bool);
function cancelAppointment(uint256 appointmentId) public returns (bool);

3. Blockchain Integration
Implement the OKTO SDK to facilitate wallet connections and transactions.
Ensure compatibility with both Solana and EVM chains by using appropriate libraries (e.g., Web3.js for EVM, Solana Web3.js for Solana).
4. Backend Services
Use a decentralized storage solution like IPFS to store non-sensitive data (e.g., appointment history).
If sensitive data needs to be stored off-chain, consider traditional databases with encryption.
5. Payment Processing
Integrate payment gateways that allow users to pay for services using cryptocurrencies or traditional payment methods.
Smart contracts can handle payment confirmations post-appointment booking.
