# Amalgam DApp Overview

## Introduction

Amalgam is a decentralized application (DApp) designed for secure sharing of Electronic Medical Records (EMR) utilizing blockchain technology. This project is submitted for the Blockchain Hackathon Encode Chain-Abstraction 2024, aiming to enhance data privacy and interoperability in healthcare.

## Features

- **Secure Data Sharing**: Utilizes advanced encryption techniques and proxy re-encryption to ensure that EMR data remains confidential during sharing between authorized users.
- **Chain Abstraction**: Implements Particle Network's chain abstraction technology to simplify interactions across multiple blockchains, allowing seamless access to EMR data without the need for managing multiple wallets or chains.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Designed with a focus on user experience, enabling healthcare professionals to easily access and share patient records while maintaining compliance with privacy regulations.

## Technology Stack

- **Blockchain**: Built on a robust blockchain framework that supports decentralized storage and secure transactions.
- **LightProtocol**: Utilized for handling encrypted data sharing, ensuring that only authorized parties can decrypt and access sensitive information.
- **Particle Network**: Leverages account-level chain abstraction to enable smooth interactions between different blockchains, enhancing the DApp's scalability and usability.

## Getting Started

To set up the Amalgam DApp locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/amalgam-dapp.git
   cd amalgam-dapp
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Configure Environment Variables**
   Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your blockchain node URLs and other necessary configurations.

4. **Run the DApp**

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

5. **Access the DApp**
   Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to start using the Amalgam DApp.

## Use Cases

- **Healthcare Providers**: Securely share patient records with specialists while maintaining patient confidentiality.
- **Patients**: Control access to their medical records and grant permissions to healthcare providers as needed.

## Features

- **Insurance Management**: Patients can purchase insurance policies directly through the DApp.
- **EMR as NFTs**: Doctors can create EMRs as NFTs, providing proof of patient diagnoses and treatments.
- **Insurance Payments**: Insurance companies can pay hospitals for treatment claims.
- **Pharmaceutical Integration**: Pharmaceutical companies can provide drug information and pricing.
